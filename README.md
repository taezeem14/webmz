**Webmzn** is a sleek and minimal dashboard that automatically fetches and displays all my GitHub repositories in one place.  
Built to be clean, fast, responsive — with zero frameworks and 100% pure Taezeem energy.

> 🔁 Formerly known as `Webman`.

## 🛠 How It Works

- Uses `https://api.github.com/users/taezeem14/repos` to fetch repositories  
- Filters:
  - Forks = ❌
  - Everything else = ✅
- Sorts projects by `updated_at` (newest at the top in v1)
- Displays each repo as a card with:
  - Title
  - Link to GitHub Pages (if deployed)
  - Last updated date
